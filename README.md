# **Data Analysis**

This Github repository is dedicated to my data analysis portfolio. Here, I'll share projects and ideas related to my work with data.

# **Repository Structure**

Each project has its own directory inside the 'data-analysis' repository, and within each project directory, all the necessary files such as source code, datasets, documentations, and results are included.
